    "🧠 Concept: What git init and “upstream” actually do\n",
    "Command\tPurpose\tWhen You Use It\n",
    "git init\tInitializes a new local Git repository (creates a .git folder).\tWhen starting a brand new project that doesn’t exist yet on GitHub or anywhere else.\n",
    "git remote add origin <URL>\tLinks your local repo to a remote GitHub repo.\tAfter git init, so Git knows where to push/pull from.\n",
    "git push --set-upstream origin <branch>\tSets the upstream tracking branch for your current local branch.\tWhen your branch doesn’t have a remote tracking branch yet.\n",
    "🚫 Why You can’t replace git init with setting an upstream\n",
    "\n",
    "You must already have a Git repo (created by git init or git clone) before you can set an upstream branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven’t run git init or git clone, you don’t even have a .git folder — so Git doesn’t know what “branch” or “remote” means yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "🔧 git init = Create the toolbox\n",
    "🔗 git remote add origin = Tell Git where your cloud toolbox is\n",
    "🚀 git push --set-upstream origin my-branch = Sync your local tool with its cloud version\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Example Workflow (for a new branch)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you already have a repo set up (either cloned or initialized):\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Create a new branch locally\n",
    "git checkout -b feature/new-feature\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Make your changes and commit them\n",
    "git add .\n",
    "git commit -m \"Add new feature\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Push and set upstream tracking\n",
    "git push --set-upstream origin feature/new-feature\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, you can just use:\n",
    "\n",
    "git push\n",
    "git pull\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "and Git will automatically know where to send and fetch changes for that branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧩 Quick check if you have an upstream set\n",
    "git branch -vv\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll see something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* feature/new-feature  abc123 [origin/feature/new-feature] Add new feature\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If there’s no [origin/... ], then no upstream is set yet."
